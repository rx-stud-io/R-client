\arguments{
\item{PATID}{Patient Identifier. User-provided free text (such as patient id, name or alias) to identify related simulations. Must be provided as string.}

\item{AGE}{Age. Age of the patient in years. Must be provided as numeric (min. 18, max. 120 year).}

\item{HEIGHT}{Height. Height of the patient. Must be provided as numeric (min. 100, max. 250 cm).}

\item{WEIGHT}{Weight. Actual body weight of the patient. Must be provided as numeric (min. 20, max. 500 kg).}

\item{GENDER}{Sex. Patient's sex for clinical decision-making. Must be provided as string ('Male' or 'Female').}

\item{PHENYTOINFORM}{Phenytoin form. Form of phenytoin to be used during simulations. Must be provided as string ('Phenytoin sodium IV' or 'Fosphenytoin sodium IV').}

\item{MODEL}{Model for population of interest. Pharmacokinetic model to be used for specific patient type during simulations. Must be provided as string ('Muñoz et al. (2019) - ICU').}

\item{ALBUMIN}{Albumin. Serum albumin. Must be provided as numeric (min. 0.01, max. 15 g/dL).}

\item{RENALFUNCTIONSTATUS}{Renal function status. Renal function status of the patient. Must be provided as string ('Patients without renal impairment' or 'Dialysis or End-Stage Renal Disease').}

\item{VALPROICACID}{Valproic acid blood level (leave empty if none). Total valproic acid concentration, leave empty or set to zero if no concurrent administration. Must be provided as numeric (min. 0, max. 500 mg/L).}

\item{LOADINGDOSEPERKG}{Required loading dose per kg. Required loading dose in mg/kg, calculated for the corrected weight. Must be provided as numeric (min. 1, max. 100 mg(PE)/kg).}

\item{CPOSTDOSE24H}{Post-dose plasma concentration after 24 hrs target. The PK/PD target can be provided as post-dose blood plasma concentration after 24 hrs (Cmin). Must be provided as numeric (min. 0.1, max. 200 mg/L).}
