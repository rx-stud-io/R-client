\arguments{
\item{PATID}{Patient Identifier. User-provided free text (such as patient id, name or alias) to identify related simulations. Must be provided as string.}

\item{AGE}{Age. Age of the patient in years. Must be provided as numeric (min. 18, max. 120 year).}

\item{HEIGHT}{Height. Height of the patient. Must be provided as numeric (min. 100, max. 250 cm).}

\item{WEIGHT}{Weight. Actual body weight of the patient. Must be provided as numeric (min. 20, max. 500 kg).}

\item{GENDER}{Sex. Patient's sex for clinical decision-making. Must be provided as string ('Male' or 'Female').}

\item{MODEL}{Model for population of interest. Pharmacokinetic model to be used for specific patient type during simulations. Must be provided as string ('Pascual et al. (2012) - patients with invasive fungal infections').}

\item{RIFAMPICIN}{Concurrent rifampicin. Presence of rifampicin coadministration. Must be provided as string ('No' or 'Yes').}

\item{SEVEREHEPATICCHOLESTASIS}{Severe hepatic cholestasis. Severe hepatic cholestasis is defined as any liver function tests > 20 times the upper limit of normal (e.g. alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT or GGT). Must be provided as string ('No' or 'Yes').}

\item{CMINPERMIC}{Minimum concentration to MIC ratio target. The PK/PD target can be provided as minimum concentration to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (Cmin/MIC). Must be provided as numeric (min. 0.1, max. 50 ).}

\item{ORALORIVBAREHISTORY}{Historical Records.  Must be provided as list of 2-24 'HISTDOSE', 'HISTORALDOSE' or 'HISTCONCENTRATION' values.}

\item{ORALORIVORKGREGIMENS}{Dosing Regimens. List of dosing regimens to be used in simulating target attainment, from which the dosing regimen with the smallest absolute difference from the desired target will be automatically selected. Must be provided as list of 1-20 'KGREGIMEN', 'REGIMEN' or 'ORALREGIMEN' values. Use the \code{regimen} helper function to define the REGIMEN values.}

\description{
Voriconazole » Bayesian adaptive dosing » Total minimum concentration to MIC ratio
}
\details{
\strong{Drug}:
Voriconazole

\strong{Method}:
Estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters of the patient from past concentrations and creatinine levels with Bayesian inverse modeling, then use that information to predict the steady state concentrations for multiple dosing regimens and select the optimal one, with regard to the target pharmacodynamic index.

\strong{PK/PD target}:
Minimum concentration (mg/L) to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (mg/L).
